Hi guys! First time working with node.js just want to make sure I can do little things with it so I have used:

	- node.js
	- express.js
	- faye.js
	

I'm a ux / design guy and it's my first public release on GitHub, but I hope you like it and find it useful.



Comments and improvements will be really appreciated,

Cheers!
